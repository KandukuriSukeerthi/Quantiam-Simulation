**Company**: Quantium  
**Role Simulated**: Data Analyst – Retail Analytics  
**Project**: Consumer Behavior Analysis and Retail Experiment Performance Evaluation for the Chips Category.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project was completed as part of Quantium's virtual internship program and included two core tasks:

1. **Customer Segmentation and Insights**  
2. **Retail Store Trial Analysis**

The goal was to analyze transaction and customer data to uncover behavioral patterns and measure the impact of a pricing and placement trial using statistical rigor.

## 🔍 Task 1: Customer Segmentation & Insights

Key focus areas:
- Data cleaning and preparation using **R** (`data.table`, `ggplot2`)
- Merged transactional and customer datasets
- Identified high-value segments: **Mainstream Mid-age & Young Singles/Couples**
- Conducted:
  - **Sales performance breakdown** by life stage and premium status
  - **T-tests** to validate significant pricing differences
  - **Brand & pack size preference analysis** using proportional comparison and visualizations

🧩 *Insights:*
- These segments have high spend per transaction and prefer **premium brands** (e.g., Tyrrells, Doritos).
- Strong preference for **larger pack sizes** (270g, 330g, 380g).

## 🧪 Task 2: Retail Trial Evaluation

Objectives:
- Evaluate performance of a marketing trial in 3 stores using matched control stores
- Apply **correlation and magnitude scoring** to identify control stores
- Conduct **pre-post statistical testing** (t-tests) for:
  - Total sales uplift
  - Change in customer count

🧪 *Methods Used:*
- Time series analysis
- Control store selection using similarity scoring
- Statistical validation with confidence intervals and hypothesis testing

📈 *Findings:*
- Stores **77 and 88** showed statistically significant sales and customer growth.
- Store **86** showed growth in customers, but not in total sales — further review recommended.
